#multiple choice:
#[ "Imagine if you were at the beach and noticed that a wave hits the shore every 5 seconds. What is the frequency?"
# a. 5 Hz, b. 0.5 Hz, c. 0.2 Hz, d. 10 Hz
# correct answer = C ]
#[ "Which kind of wave does not need a medium to pass through?"
# a. sound wave, b. light wave, c. water wave, d.seismic waves
#correct answer = B ]

#true or false
#[ "TRUE OR FALSE!!"]
#[ "When a wave does not require a medium, it is considered a Mechanical wave."
# correct = FALSE, if modified = electromagnetic wave ]
#["In a wave, period and frequency are inversely proportional.
# correct = TRUE ]
#[ "If a wave bends, then it is considered as diffraction."
# correct = FALSE, if modified = refraction]
