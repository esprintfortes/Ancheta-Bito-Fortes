# HOW TO BECOME A PHYSICS PRO

“Gravity pulls with Curiosity” is an engaging software program designed to simplify and make learning easier by providing an interactive 
and a collaborative platform for our fellow students to engage with various topics about physics through quizzes and other features. 
By empowering users to both create and participate, the platform actively works to foster curiosity, spark creativity, and develop critical thinking skills, all while encouraging academic excellence.

“Gravity pulls with Curiosity” can help bridge the gap between knowledge and application, contributing to the development of a more informed, engaged, and curious community. Now our students can take that Summative Achievement Exam with ease, for Physics, relieving such a big burden!

We heard your voices! Students often struggle, no doubt. Well, this is the very reason we created this project. From the compassionate hearts of our group to the very resilient makers and founders of this CURIOUS scholars, we take the initiative to start anew.








This is the project “Gravity pulls with Curiosity.” Where limited ideas are taken into software with no limits.
